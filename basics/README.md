DESCRIPTION OF EACH SCRIPT

0) I have write a script that prints the absolute path name of the current working directory.

1) I have display the contents list of my current directory.

2) I have write a script that changes the working directory to the userâ€™s home directory. 

3) I have display current directory contents in a long format.

4) I have display current directory contents, including hidden files (starting with .). Using the long format.

5) I have display current directory contents.

6) I have create a script that creates a directory named my_first_directory in the /tmp/ directory.

7) I have move the file betty from /tmp/ to /tmp/my_first_directory.

8) I have delete the file betty.(The file betty is in /tmp/my_first_directory.)

9) I have delete the directory my_first_directory that is in the /tmp directory.

10) I have write a script that changes the working directory to the previous one.

11) I have write a script that lists all files (even ones with names beginning with a period character, which are normally hidden) in the current directory and the parent of the working directory and the /boot directory (in this order), in long format.

12) I have write a script that prints the type of the file named iamafile. The file iamafile will be in the /tmp directory when you will run my script.

13) I have create a symbolic link to /bin/ls, named __ls__. The symbolic link is created in the current working directory.

14) I have create a script that copies all the HTML files from the current working directory to the parent of the working directory, but only copy files that did not exist in the parent of the working directory or were newer than the versions in the parent of the working directory. I consider that all HTML files have the extension .html.

15) I have create a script that moves all files beginning with an uppercase letter to the directory /tmp/u.I assume that the directory /tmp/u will exist when you will run my script
